- 👋 Hi, I’m Stanislao
- 👀 I’m interested in learning anything...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use Linux (both Mint and Ubuntu) and then understand what I can do with a server at home: I would like to leave the PC turned on, as a server, with which to upload and download documents, music and films and run applications 24 hours a day - for example home assistant. All on the local network
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...I'd like to but I have to learn first
- 📫 How to reach me ... fiorillo.stani@gmail.com
